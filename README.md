# #U1_Unit_Project_Ambroise

<h2> Project Description: </h2>
<p> This project is a multiple activity project where you can choose from Game, Music and Art. In this project, you are able to listen
to music, play a game or watch art create itself. All of the activities come from my projects. But I made them way cooler.</p>

<h2> Inspiration: </h2>
<p> My inspiration was my games, I loved my games to much that I wanted to make all of them better so I got the idea of have a project
with all 3 project inside of it. That is when I got the idea of have an interactive.activity project. I also had the inspiration of how
each of my projects are different so all together they would fit well into one project.</p>
